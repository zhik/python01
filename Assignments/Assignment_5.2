Hello Fellows!

Write a program that repeatedly prompts a user for integer numbers until the user enters 'done'. 
Once 'done' is entered, print out the largest and smallest of the numbers. 
If the user enters anything other than a valid number catch it with a try/except and put out an appropriate message and ignore the number.


Begin writing the program with the code below:
largest = None
smallest = None
while True:
    num = raw_input("Enter a number: ")
    if num == "done" : break
    print num

print "Maximum", largest



Happy Coding,
