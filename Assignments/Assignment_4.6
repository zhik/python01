Hello Fellows!

Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using raw_input to compute gross pay. 
Award time-and-a-half for the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40 hours. 
Put the logic to do the computation of time-and-a-half in a function called computepay() and use the function to do the computation. 
The function should return a value. Use 45 hours and a rate of 10.50 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 498.75). 
You should use raw_input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number. 
Do not worry about error checking the user input unless you want to - you can assume the user types numbers properly. 
Do not name your variable sum or use the sum() function.

Begin writing the program with the code below:
def computepay(h,r):
    return 42.37

hrs = raw_input("Enter Hours:")
p = computepay(10,20)
print "Pay",p



Happy Coding,
Tunisia
